title: "Yanny-Laurel Preprocessing"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Preprocessing
Hello!

Let's get started. First, set working directory to where this file is by going to the 'Session' tab, then 'Set Workspace Directory' > 'To Source File Location'.

Something like this should show up in your console: `setwd("[wherever you saved the repository]/yanny-laurel-demo/2_analysis")`

We like to use relative paths instead of absolute paths. Absolute paths are directories
that are specific to your computer. For example, this file is located on my computer
by the following path: `setwd("D:/GitRepos/yanny-laurel-demo/2_analysis")`

But if I put that in the code, then it would fail when you try to run it because that
path probably does not exist on your computer. 

A much better (i.e. more reproducible and resilient) way of coding is to organize
your project so that you or anyone else can simply set the working directory to the
folder where the analysis scripts are (or the main folder of the directory), and 
"access" everything else from there. 

So what would this look like? 
Like so: 
```{r}
# set working directory to source file location
data_path = file.path('../data') 
results_path = file.path('../3_results')
# the '.' means "working directory"
# the '/' means go down one folder level
# the '../' means go up one folder level
```
So since we are setting the working directory to this file, we have to go up one
level (to the main folder), then down to access the 'data' and 'results' folders. 

### Load Data
```{r}
# first let's check to make sure we're in the right place:
(file <- list.files(data_path))
# now load
read.csv(file.path(data_path,file))
```
```{r}
read.csv(file.path(data_path,file),nrows = 12)

```
